# **Team balancer**

This Java program is designed to balance teams based on the skills of individual players. 
It provides methods to find teams with the lowest overall skill and the smallest number of players.
The algorithm adjusts the number of teams if the total number of players is not divisible by the specified number of teams.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
* Gradle build tool installed on your system.

## How to run tests

**1. Clone the repository:**

`git clone <url>
cd team_balancer`

**2. Compile and run test using Gradle**

`gradle test`

This command compiles the code and runs all the unit tests. The test results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Running the Algorithm

To use team balancing algorithm in your Java project, follow these steps:

**1. Import the TeamBalancer class.**

**2. Adjust the Algorithm Parameters.**

Modify the 'numberOfTeams' variable to specify the desired number of teams for balancing.
Ensure that the 'individuals' map contains the player names as keys and their corresponding skills as values.

**3. Run Your Application.**

Compile and run your Java application to see balanced teams based on the provided input data.
